# Kidney and Kidney Tumor Segmentation using MONAI's UNet3D

This project demonstrates the use of MONAI's UNet3D architecture for segmenting the kidney and kidney tumor from 3D medical imaging datasets. MONAI (Medical Open Network for AI) provides a specialized deep learning framework for healthcare research, making it ideal for tasks such as medical image segmentation.

## **Features**
- Implementation of UNet3D for volumetric segmentation.
- Focused segmentation of kidneys and kidney tumors.
- Use of MONAI's powerful data pipeline for preprocessing and training.
- Easy-to-adapt code for other 3D segmentation tasks.

## **Requirements**
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.8+
- MONAI
- PyTorch
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- nibabel (for handling NIfTI files)
- scikit-learn (for evaluation metrics)

## **Run**
Run Segmentation.py
Trained Weight is stored in last_model.pth.
